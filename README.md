# Finals Lab Task 6.  MOngoDBCRUD
In this task, I learned that MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional relational tables. It’s designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, with collections that don’t require a fixed schema. MongoDB also offers features like horizontal scaling, indexing, and an aggregation framework, making it suitable for high-performance, dynamic applications. However, I learned that it may not be the best choice for applications needing strict consistency or complex relational queries.
Here are the tasks that were provided and the code for the MongoDB:
